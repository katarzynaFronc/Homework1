        <h1>"Thinking Like a Mountain"</h1>
        <h3>Leopold Aldo</h3>
        <p>
          A deep chesty bawl echoes from rimrock to rimrock, rolls down the
          mountain, and fades into the far blackness of the night. It is an
          outburst of wild defiant sorrow, and of contempt for all the
          adversities of the world. Every living thing (and perhaps many a dead
          one as well) pays heed to that call. To the deer it is a reminder of
          the way of all flesh, to the pine a forecast of midnight scuffles and
          of blood upon the snow, to the coyote a promise of gleanings to come,
          to the cowman a threat of red ink at the bank, to the hunter a
          challenge of fang against bullet. Yet behind these obvious and
          immediate hopes and fears there lies a deeper meaning, known only to
          the mountain itself.
          <b
            >Only the mountain has lived long enough to listen objectively to
            the howl of a wolf.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Those unable to decipher the hidden meaning know nevertheless that it
          is there, for it is felt in all wolf country, and distinguishes that
          country from all other land. It tingles in the spine of all who hear
          wolves by night, or who scan their tracks by day. Even without sight
          or sound of wolf, it is impliCit in a hundred small events: the
          midnight whinny of a pack horse, the rattle of rolling rocks, the
          bound of a fleeing deer, the way shadows lie under the spruces. Only
          the ineducable tyro can fail to sense the presence or absence of
          wolves, or the fact that mountains have a secret opinion about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My own conviction on this score dates from the day I saw a wolf die.
          We were eating lunch on a high rimrock, at the foot of which a
          turbulent river elbowed its way. We saw what we thought was a doe
          fording the torrent, her breast awash in white water. When she climbed
          the bank toward us and shook out her tail, we realized our error: it
          was a wolf. A half-dozen others, evidently grown pups, sprang from the
          willows and all joined in a welcoming melee of wagging tails and
          playful mauUngs. What was literally a pile of wolves writhed and
          tumbled in the center of an open flat at the foot of our rimrock.
        </p>
        <p>
          In those days we had never heard of passing up a chance to kill a
          wolf. In a second we were pumping lead into the pack, but with more
          excitement than accuracy: how to aim a steep downhill shot is always
          confusing. When our rifles were empty, the old wolf was down, and a
          pup was dragging a leg into impassable slide-rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in
          her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was
          something new to me in those eyes something known only to her and to
          the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought
          that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean
          hunters paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that
          neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have lived to see state after state extirpate its wolves.
          I have watched the face of many a newly wolfless mountain, and seen
          the south-facing slopes wrinkle with a maze of new deer trails. I have
          seen every edible bush and seedling browsed, first to anaemic
          desuetude, and then to death. I have seen every edible tree defoliated
          to the height of a saddlehorn. Such a mountain looks as if someone had
          given God a new pruning shears, and forbidden Him all other exercise.
          In the end the starved bones of the hoped-for deer herd, dead of its
          own too-much, bleach with the bones of the dead sage, or molder under
          the high-lined junipers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I now suspect that just as a deer herd Lives in mortal fear of its
          wolves, so does a mountain live in mortal fear of its deer. And
          perhaps with better cause, for while a buck pulled down by wolves can
          be replaced in two or three years, a range pulled down by too many
          deer may fail of replacement in as many decades. So also with cows.
          The cowman who cleans his range of wolves does not realize that he is
          taking over the wolfs job of trimming the herd to fit the range. He
          has not learned to think Uke a mountain. Hence we have dustbowls, and
          rivers washing the future into the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all strive for safety, prosperity, comfort, long life, and
          dullness. The deer strives with his supple legs, the cowman with trap
          and poison, the statesman with pen, the most of us with machines,
          votes, and dollars, but it all comes to the same thing: peace in our
          time. A measure of success in this is all well enough, and perhaps is
          a requisite to objective thinking, but too much safety seems to yield
          only danger in the long run.
          <b
            >Perhaps this is behind Thoreau's dictum: In wildness is the
            salvation of the world. Perhaps this is the hidden meaning in the
            howl of the wolf, long known among mountains, but seldom perceived
            among men.</b
